    to the C++ Microsoft was pushing. However, Netscape didn''t have an answer to
    Visual Basic. Visual Basic was an easier to use programming language, which was
    targeted at developers with less experience. It avoided some of the difficulties

    had been renamed JavaScript to tie it into the Java applet integration. Java Applets
    were small applications which ran in the browser. They had a different security
    model from the browser itself and so were limited in how they could interact with
    both the browser and the local system. It is quite rare to see applets these days,

    for the near future. In order to limit the amount of language deviation between
    implementations, Sun and Netscape began working with the **European Computer Manufacturers**
    **Association** (**ECMA**) to develop a standard to which future versions of JavaScript
    would need to comply. The standard was released very quickly (very quickly in
    terms of how rapidly standards organizations move), in July of 1997\. On the off

    was called **ECMAScript**, a name which still persists in some circles.

- en: Unfortunately, the standard only specified the very core parts of JavaScript.
    With the browser wars raging, it was apparent that any vendor that stuck with
    only the basic implementation of JavaScript would quickly be left behind. At the

- en: For many years, every JavaScript script would start by attempting to determine
    the browser on which it was running. This would dictate how to address elements
    in the DOM, as there were dramatic deviations between each browser. The spaghetti
    of code that was required to perform simple actions was legendary. I remember
    reading a year-long 20-part series on developing a **Dynamic HTML** (**DHTML**)

    is common to text editors, drawing programs, and even e-mail clients. Solving
    this problem has been done many times before so it would be great to have a common
    solution. The command pattern provides just such a common solution. It suggests
    keeping track of all the actions performed in an application as instances of a
    command. This command will have forward and reverse actions. Every time a command
    is processed it is placed onto a queue. When it comes time to undo a command it
    is as simple as popping the top command off of the command queue and executing
    the undo action on it.
