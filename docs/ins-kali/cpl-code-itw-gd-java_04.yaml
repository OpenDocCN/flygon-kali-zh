    your experience, character, and personality, and your ability to fit in with other
    employees and teams. **Being a good fit in the existing team(s) is a must**. These
    questions are also useful for creating a human connection between you and the

    ideal candidate and your education, beliefs, ideas, expectations, culture, and

- en: '**Don''t detail your experience as a boring list of chronological facts**:
    Choose the most representative projects and achievements and talk about them with
    enthusiasm. Talk about your work with enthusiasm (but don''t look desperate and
    don''t exaggerate), and place your achievements in the context of the team/project.
    For example, avoid saying,... *and I did this and that on my own!* It is better
    to say,*... and I helped my team by doing this and that.* Don''t say,*...I was
    the only one capable of doing that.* Prefer saying*...I was nominated by the team
    to accomplish this delicate task*. If you are in your first job, then talk about
    your school projects (think of your colleagues as your team) and about your independent
    projects. If you have participated in programming contests, then talk about your
    results and experience.'

  zh: '**不要把你的经验详细描述成无聊的时间线清单**：选择最具代表性的项目和成就，并充满热情地谈论它们。充满热情地谈论你的工作（但不要显得绝望，也不要夸大），并将你的成就放在团队/项目的背景下。例如，避免说...
    *我独自完成了这个和那个！* 最好说，*...我通过做这个和那个来帮助我的团队。* 不要说，*...我是唯一一个能够做到那个的人。* 更好的说法是*...我被团队提名来完成这个棘手的任务*。如果你是第一份工作，那么谈谈你的学校项目（把你的同事看作你的团队）和你的独立项目。如果你参加过编程比赛，那么谈谈你的成绩和经验。'
- en: '**Don''t highlight only the positive things**: Experiences can be positive
    and negative. Talk about what went right, but also about what went wrong. Most
    of the time, the truly valuable lessons come from negative experiences. These
    kinds of experiences force us to go beyond our limits to find solutions. Moreover,
    such experiences are proof of resistance to stress, tenacity, and power of concentration.
    Of course, balance positive and negative experiences and highlight what you''ve
    learned from both sides.'

  zh: 你最喜欢的编程语言是什么？
- en: Since we are talking about a Java position, it's obvious that your favorite
    language is Java. But if such a question arises, then it is meant to reveal whether
    you are Java-addicted or an open-minded person. In other words, the interviewer
    considers that it's hard to work with rigid people who are addicted to one programming
    language and want to use it exclusively in all situations. Being a Java developer
    doesn't mean that you should consider Java for all your tasks and ignore everything
    else. So, a good answer might be, *Obviously, I am a big fan of Java, but I also
    consider it important to pick the best tool for the job. It is absurd to believe
    that Java is the answer to all problems.*
  id: totrans-28
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 既然我们在谈论Java职位，显然你最喜欢的语言是Java。但如果出现这样的问题，那么它的目的是要揭示你是Java迷还是一个开放思想的人。换句话说，面试官认为与固执的、沉迷于一种编程语言并希望在所有情况下都专门使用它的人一起工作是很困难的。成为一名Java开发人员并不意味着你应该考虑Java来解决你所有的任务，并忽略其他一切。因此，一个好的答案可能是，“显然，我是Java的忠实粉丝，但我也认为选择最适合工作的工具很重要。认为Java是所有问题的答案是荒谬的。”

    sincere and tell the interviewer exactly what you want to do. You read the job
    description; therefore, you know that you want this job. Explain to the interviewer
    the main reasons behind your decision. For example, you could say, *I want to
    become an excellent Java backend developer and your projects are quite challenging
    in this area. I want to be part of the team that works on these projects.* Or,
    you could say, *I want to be part of a major start-up in an important company
    and this looks like a great opportunity for me. I heard that a new team is being
    formed and I would be very excited to be part of it.* Don't omit saying something
    about working in a great team! Most probably, you won't be working alone, and
    being a team player is a major aspect of working in almost any company.

    They seek to understand if you see this position as part of your career path,
    or if you have other reasons (apart from the money) for doing it. It is hard to
    describe a detailed career path, but you could give an answer that shows your
    commitment and motivation to do your job right. For example, you could say, *My
    current goal is to work as a Java backend developer on challenging projects that
    will help me to accumulate more experience. In several years, I see myself involved
    in architecting complex Java applications. Beyond that is too far away to think

    style and underline indirectly the things that you do not agree with. For example,

    like to start working in the morning with the most difficult tasks, and in the
    second part of the day, I will deal with the planning of the next day.* Or, you

    to know why you took this decision. The key here is to detail clear and solid
    arguments without saying anything bad or offensive about your previous company,

- en: '**Don''t cite money as the first argument**: Money is often a good reason to
    change jobs but citing it as the first argument is a dangerous route to take.
    The interviewer may think that all you care about is money. Or, they may think
    that your current employer didn''t raise your salary because you were not valuable

    an evasive answer such as, *We customize the salary depending on the applicant,
    therefore, I need to know your expectations.* In such a scenario, say the higher
    number you have in mind. Most probably, you will not get this offer, but it gives
    you room to negotiate. Be short and direct; for example, say, *I''m expecting
    to $65,000 a year.* You should get around $60,000 or an answer that will disappoint
    you like, *Sorry, but we had a much lower number in mind.* This leads to the next
    section.'

  zh: '**得到含糊的答复**：与其得到一个报价范围，你可能会得到一个含糊的答复，比如说，*我们根据申请者定制薪水，因此，我需要知道你的期望。* 在这种情况下，说出你心中的更高数字。很可能你不会得到这个报价，但这给了你谈判的空间。要简短直接；例如，说，*我期望年薪65,000美元。*
    你可能会得到大约60,000美元的报价，或者一个让你失望的答复，比如说，*抱歉，但我们心目中的数字要低得多。* 这将导致下一节。'
- en: '**Getting a disappointing offer**: In this scenario, try to be very prompt
    and start by expressing your disappointment like, *I have to say that I am very
    disappointed with this offer.* Continue by reiterating your strong skills and
    experience. Try to make clear arguments that support the requested number and
    underline that you do not want anything outlandish. If you are not open to accepting
    this job with these conditions, then finish your response with an ultimatum like,
    *If this is your final word, I cannot accept such an offer.* If the company was
    impressed by you, it''s possible they''d require more time and get back to you
    with another offer. If you''re thinking about accepting the offer, then ask for
    a written agreement for renegotiation in six months for now. Moreover, try to
    squeeze other benefits out of the negotations, such as flexible hours, bonuses,
    and so on.'

  zh: '**得到令人失望的报价**：在这种情况下，要迅速表达你的失望，比如说，*我不得不说我对这个报价非常失望。* 然后重申你的强大技能和经验。试着提出明确的支持所要求数字的论点，并强调你不想要什么离谱的东西。如果你不愿意接受这份工作的这些条件，那么在回答结束时加上一个最后通牒，比如说，*如果这是你们的最终答复，我无法接受这样的报价。*
    如果公司对你印象深刻，他们可能需要更多时间，然后会给你另一个报价。如果你考虑接受这个报价，那么要求书面协议，在六个月后重新谈判。此外，试着从谈判中挤出其他好处，比如灵活的工作时间、奖金等等。'

  zh: 重要提示
- en: As a rule of thumb, try to keep in mind the following aspects:- Don't get shy
    or embarrassed when talking about salaries (novices often do).- Don't start from
    low numbers that don't give you room for negotiation.- Don't underestimate yourself
    and sell yourself short.- Don't lose time trying to negotiate non-negotiable things.

  zh: 作为一个经验法则，要记住以下几个方面：- 谈论薪水时不要害羞或尴尬（新手们经常会这样）。- 不要从不给你谈判空间的低数字开始。- 不要低估自己，卖自己短。-
    不要浪费时间谈判不可谈判的事情。

  zh: 你有问题要问我吗？
- en: Almost any interview ends with this question. The interviewer wants to clarify
    any remaining doubts that you may have. You can ask whatever you want, but pay
    attention not to ask something stupid or something that requires a long answer.
    You can ask details about something that the interviewer said but that was not
    very clear, or you can ask for their personal opinion about you. Or, you could
    ask something like, *How did you come to this company? What has been most challenging
    for you?* If you have nothing to ask, then don't ask. Simply say something like,
    *Well, I have to say that you've answered all my important questions. Thank you
    for your time!*.

  zh: 几乎任何面试都以这个问题结束。面试官想要澄清你可能有的任何疑虑。你可以问任何你想问的问题，但要注意不要问一些愚蠢的问题或需要长篇回答的问题。你可以询问面试官说过但不太清楚的事情的细节，或者你可以询问他们对你的个人看法。或者，你可以问一些类似“你是怎么来到这家公司的？对你来说最具挑战性的是什么？”的问题。如果你没有问题要问，那就不要问。简单地说一些像“嗯，我必须说你已经回答了我所有重要的问题。谢谢你的时间！”的话。

  zh: 总结
- en: In this chapter, we covered the most common non-technical questions that you
    can face in an interview. These questions should be seriously trained for before
    the interview because they represent an important part of a successful interview.
    It's true that great answers to these questions will not bring you an offer alone,
    without a solid demonstration of the required technical knowledge, but they can
    impact your salary offer, your daily job expectations, your working style, and
    career goals. Therefore, don't go unprepared to such an interview.

  zh: 在本章中，我们涵盖了面试中你可能面对的最常见的非技术问题。这些问题在面试前应该认真训练，因为它们是成功面试的重要组成部分。的确，对这些问题的出色回答单独并不能带给你一个offer，没有必要的技术知识的充分展示，但它们可以影响你的薪水待遇、日常工作期望、工作风格和职业目标。因此，不要在这样的面试中毫无准备。
