    without significant market impact, you do not own anything. It owns you. The way
    to approach liquidity on the short side is radically different. On the long side,
    liquidity increases as more investors are drawn to rising prices. Early birds

    street. After a beating, they don't come back for round two. Nothing captures
    the emotional journey of long market participants more faithfully than the Kübler-Ross
    model. Market participants grieve their losses. Each phase even has a distinctive
    signature on the markets. Interest wanes, and as the pool of market participants
    shrinks, so does liquidity. Early bear markets are a lot more liquid than later-stage
    ones. Short sellers exit into thinner liquidity than they entered.

- en: This limits the investment universe to issues where liquidity is not a problem.
    The resolution of the 2008 great financial crisis got the markets addicted to
    quantitative easing, otherwise known as free money. In layman's terms, monetary
    authorities flooded the world with painkillers to ease the pain of an economic
    crisis. As soon as monetary authorities hint at tapering off, markets spiral down
    in withdrawal, and traders flock to safer, more defensive stocks, which is known
    as "risk-off." This forces monetary cavalry to keep pumping more painkillers into
    the system, which sends all kinds of speculative assets deep into bubble territory.
    When risk is 'on' and traders are looking for riskier stocks with more profit
    potential, small-mid caps are where the action is happening. Meanwhile, on the
    short side, boring blue chips are out of style. Whenever there is no accountability
    for failure, there is no incentive to play safe. When risk is 'off', and market
    participants are investing more defensively, they gravitate toward larger capitalizations,
    where liquidity remains abundant. Reverting the long-small/short-large caps trade
    is not easy. Shorting small caps is a bloody sport. Liquidity evaporates, and
    you can dock a supertanker in the bid/ask spread. So, gains can be wiped out at
    the first squeeze.

    a long-only manager to take a minuscule speculative long position. Since the buy/sell

    the tourists out. They would frantically cover, which would rapidly morph into
    a short squeeze. At this point, the long-only manager would leisurely exit their

    These range from **general collateral** (**GC**) on easy-to-borrow issues to prohibitive
    rates on hard-to-borrow or crowded shorts. As borrow gradually gets taken out,
    the quality of the remaining pool deteriorates. Adding to this, hard-to-borrow
    issues do not only fetch usury rates that would make Shakespeare's Shylock blush;
    they are sometimes callable. This means the lenders have the option of withdrawing
    their lending back on short notice. This is referred to as "**recall**." When
    recalls happen, short sellers are left to either locate borrow elsewhere or close
    their positions. Recalls sometimes cause short squeezes.

    to sideways. After a vigorous bull phase, stocks tend to pause and digest the
    advance. This phase is known as consolidation. Stocks may be dead money for a

    a vigorous haircut. Trim your positions. Re-allocate capital to fresh ideas. If

  zh: 首先，这可能是暂时的错定价。制度可能已经从牛市转向横盘。在一个活跃的牛市阶段之后，股票往往会暂停并消化上涨。这个阶段被称为整理。股票可能会有一段时间没有变现。如果是这样，解决办法很简单。死钱走路看起来经过大幅削减后会好很多。调整你的头寸。将资金重新配置到新的想法上。如果股票再次表现出色，将有充足的时间重新进货。

    before they could make their money back in May 2007\. That was just in time for
    the next dive. In contrast, Mr. Madoff was always open for business. He had only
    2 consecutive down months. Every month was a good month to get in. Such a small
    drawdown duration is statistically improbable. The only market participant who

    drawdowns in between. Even though positive returns were not spectacular, the maximum
    drawdown of -1.56% made it look like a risk-free investment. Kahneman-Tversky
    formulated their prospect theory in a much more brilliant way: loss aversion is
    more powerful than profit-seeking. It illustrates a powerful concept: "It does
    not matter how much you make, as long as you don''t lose." Investors could set
    and forget.'

  zh: 其次，回撤的幅度：永远不要考验投资者的胃口。一旦陷入回撤，投资者会担心情况会变得多糟糕。市场可能长期平均上涨7%，方便地忽略了其中的-40-50%的回撤。即使正收益并不惊人，-1.56%的最大回撤使其看起来像是无风险投资。康奈曼-特沃斯基以更加精彩的方式阐述了他们的前景理论：厌恶损失比追求利润更有力。这说明了一个强大的概念：“你赚多少并不重要，只要你不亏损。”投资者可以设定并忘记。
- en: 'Third is the frequency of drawdowns: Never test the nerves of investors. Madoff
    was supposedly up 92% of the time as opposed to 63% for the S&P. S&P had 6 years
    of annual returns above 20%. It also had 4 years of negative double-digit returns.
    In comparison, Madoff''s fraudulent average return was 11.04%. Yet, the compounded
    return of S&P was 200% versus 500% for Madoff.'

  zh: 第三是回撤的频率：永远不要考验投资者的神经。据说马多夫的投资表现在92%的时间里都是上涨的，而标普指数只有63%。标普指数有6年的年度回报超过20%。它也有4年的负双位数回报。相比之下，马多夫的欺诈平均回报率为11.04%。然而，标普指数的复合回报率为200%，而马多夫为500%。
- en: Fourth is semi-correlation (correlation to down months of the S&P Index), or
    the ability to make money in down markets. At 3%, Madoff was allegedly up whenever
    the market was down. That one sealed the deal. Managers who still stand up when
    everyone else is down stand out. Their phones ring off the hook with interested
    investors.

  zh: 第四是半相关性（与标普指数下跌月的相关性），或者在下行市场中赚钱的能力。据称，马多夫在标普指数下跌时涨幅为3%。这一点敲定了交易。在其他人都在下跌时仍然站稳的经理脱颖而出。他们的电话响个不停，有兴趣的投资者络绎不绝。
- en: In the real world, generating returns like Madoff is statistically improbable.
    However, the closer you get, the more attractive your proposition becomes. If
    you manage to build a product somewhere between Madoff's Holy Grail and a passive
    investment in the index, you will get a serious edge over your competitors.

  zh: 在现实世界中，像马多夫那样获得回报是统计上不太可能的。然而，你越接近，你的提议就越有吸引力。如果你设法在马多夫的圣杯和指数的被动投资之间建立一个产品，你将比竞争对手获得更大的优势。

  zh: 摘要
- en: This short chapter is not meant to test the braincells of the reader. It is
    simply a collection of practical tips on how to avoid classic expensive pitfalls
    and meet investors' expectations. Investors do not buy into long/short products
    for long ideas. They want low-volatility uncorrelated returns. This chapter considered
    investors' expectations, while avoiding the trap of thinking of the short book
    as an afterthought of the more fun long book. If those problem stocks are removed
    from your field of vision, they will not be on your mind and this will eliminate
    temptation.

  zh: 这一简短的章节并不是为了考验读者的头脑。它只是一些关于如何避免经典昂贵陷阱并满足投资者期望的实用提示的集合。投资者不是为了长期投资理念而购买多空产品。他们想要低波动性的不相关回报。这一章考虑了投资者的期望，同时避免了将空头书视为更有趣的多头书的陷阱。如果你的视野中移除了那些问题股票，它们就不会出现在你的脑海中，这将消除诱惑。

    of you by investors, it is time to pull the trigger. In the next chapters, we
    will put everything together, and see how this can be done in practice.
