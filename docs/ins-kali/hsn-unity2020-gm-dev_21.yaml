    Sadly not. A successful game relies on heavy refinement; the devil is in the details!
    Also, don't get too hyped about earning money yet; this is your first game and
    there are a lot of non-development-related tasks to accomplish. It's time to discuss
    what can we do now with what we have achieved so far.

- en: Apart from a strong marketing strategy, the success of your game relies on the
    first 10 minutes of gameplay. If you can't get the attention of the player in
    that time, you will certainly lose them. The first impression of your game is
    important. Those first 10 minutes must be flawless and sadly, our perception of
    the game is not relevant here. You spent several hours playing it and you know
    every inch of the levels and how to properly control your character, as well as
    all the mechanics and dynamics of your game—it is YOUR game. You love it as it
    is. It's a big accomplishment. Now, someone who has never played the game won't
    feel the same way. That's why testing is so important.

  zh: 除了强大的营销策略外，你的游戏的成功还取决于游戏的前10分钟。如果你不能在那段时间内吸引玩家的注意，你肯定会失去他们。你的游戏的第一印象很重要。那前10分钟必须是完美的，但遗憾的是，我们对游戏的感知在这里并不重要。你花了好几个小时玩它，你知道每个关卡的每一寸地方，知道如何正确地控制你的角色，以及你的游戏的所有机制和动态—这是你的游戏。你爱它就是它。这是一个巨大的成就。现在，一个从未玩过游戏的人不会有同样的感觉。这就是为什么测试如此重要。
- en: The first time you make someone play your game, you will be shocked—believe
    me, I've been there. You will notice that the player probably won't understand
    the game. They won't understand how to control the player or how to win the game
    and will be stuck in parts of the level that you never imagined to be difficult.
    There will be bugs everywhere and it will be a total mess—and that is great! That
    is the exact purpose of testing your game, to get valuable information or feedback.
    This feedback is what will make your game better if you tackle it properly.
  id: totrans-13

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 第一次让别人玩你的游戏时，你会感到震惊—相信我，我也有过这种经历。你会注意到玩家可能不会理解游戏。他们不会理解如何控制玩家或者如何赢得游戏，并且会卡在你从未想象过会困难的关卡部分。到处都是bug，一团糟—但那很好！那正是测试你的游戏的目的，获得有价值的信息或反馈。如果你正确对待这些反馈，这些反馈将使你的游戏变得更好。
- en: In a testing session, there are two main sources of feedback—observation and
    user feedback. Observation is the act of silently looking at the person who is
    playing the game and seeing how they play it—which keys do they first press, what
    is their reaction when something happens, when do they start getting frustrated
    in an unexpected way (some games rely on frustration, such as *Dark Souls*), and
    generally checking that the player is getting the exact experience you expected.
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在测试会话中，有两个主要的反馈来源—观察和用户反馈。观察是默默地看着玩游戏的人，看他们如何玩—他们首先按下哪些键，当发生某事时他们的反应是什么，当他们以意想不到的方式开始感到沮丧时是什么时候（有些游戏依赖于沮丧，比如*黑暗之魂*），并且通常检查玩家是否得到了你期望的确切体验。
- en: 'The silent part of the observation is crucial. You must *not* talk to the player,
    especially not give them any hints nor help, at least not unless they are completely
    lost and the testing session can''t progress without help—a situation that is
    also a form of useful feedback in itself. You must observe the player in their
    natural state in the same situation that they will be playing your game in their
    house. If not, the feedback gathered will be biased and won''t be useful. When
    testing big games, they even carry out tests in Gesell chambers. These are rooms
    with a pane of glass that can be seen from one side only—like an interrogation
    room but less scary. This way, the player won''t feel any kind of pressure about
    being observed:'
  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 观察的沉默部分至关重要。你必须*不*与玩家交谈，尤其是不要给他们任何提示或帮助，至少在他们完全迷失并且测试会话无法继续进行而需要帮助的情况下才可以—这种情况本身也是一种有用的反馈形式。你必须观察玩家在他们自然状态下的表现，就像他们在家里玩游戏时的情况一样。如果不是这样，收集到的反馈将是有偏见的，也不会有用。在测试大型游戏时，甚至会在盖塞尔室进行测试。这些房间有一块只能从一侧看到的玻璃—就像一个审讯室，但不那么可怕。这样，玩家就不会感到任何被观察的压力：

  zh: 图21.1 – 盖塞尔室
- en: The second source is direct feedback, which is basically asking the tester about
    their impressions of the game after the session. Here, you can first let the tester
    tell you their experience and provide any feedback that they have, if any, and
    then you can start asking questions related to that feedback or other questions
    relating to the test. This could include questions such as *how did you find the
    controls? Which part of the game did you find most frustrating? Which part was
    the most rewarding? Would you pay for this game?*
  id: totrans-19
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 第二个来源是直接反馈，基本上是询问测试人员在测试后对游戏的印象。在这里，你可以先让测试人员告诉你他们的体验，并提供任何反馈，然后你可以开始问与该反馈相关的问题或与测试相关的其他问题。这可能包括问题，比如“你觉得控制方式如何？游戏中哪一部分让你最沮丧？哪一部分最有回报？你愿意为这个游戏付费吗？”
- en: Something important to consider when taking feedback from the tester is who
    they are. Are they a friend, a relative, or a total stranger? When testing with
    people close to you, it's probable that the feedback won't be useful. They will
    try to water down the poor parts of the game as they might think that you asked
    them to play the game to receive compliments, but that cannot be farther from
    the truth. You want real, harsh, objective feedback—that's the only way you can
    really improve your game.
  id: totrans-20
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在从测试人员那里接受反馈时需要考虑的一件重要事情是他们是谁。他们是朋友、亲戚还是完全陌生人？当与亲近的人一起测试时，反馈可能不会有用。他们会试图淡化游戏的不足之处，因为他们可能认为你让他们玩游戏是为了得到赞美，但事实并非如此。你需要真实、严厉、客观的反馈——这是你真正改进游戏的唯一途径。
- en: So, unless your friends are really honest with you, try to test your game on
    unknown people. This could be other students in your educational institution,
    or at your workplace, or random people in the street. Try to go to game conventions
    with spaces to showcase indie games. Also, consider your target audience when
    testing. If your game is a casual mobile game, you shouldn't be taking it to a
    Doom meet-up as you will mostly receive unrelated feedback. Know your audience
    and look for them. Also, consider that you will probably need to test your game
    on at least 10 people. You will notice that maybe one person didn't like the game
    and the other 9 did. As in statistics, your sample must be big enough to be considered
    valid.
  id: totrans-21
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以，除非你的朋友对你非常诚实，否则请尝试在陌生人身上测试你的游戏。这可以是你教育机构的其他学生，或者你的工作场所，或者街上的随机人。尝试去游戏展会上展示独立游戏。此外，在测试时要考虑你的目标受众。如果你的游戏是休闲手机游戏，你不应该把它带到“毁灭”聚会上，因为你大多会收到无关的反馈。了解你的受众并寻找他们。此外，考虑到你可能需要在至少10个人身上测试你的游戏。你会注意到也许有一个人不喜欢这个游戏，其他9个人喜欢。就像统计学一样，你的样本必须足够大才能被认为是有效的。
- en: Also, even though we said that our perception doesn't count, if you apply common
    sense and be honest with yourself, you can get feedback from your own playtesting.
    But now that we have gathered feedback, what we can do with it?

  zh: 此外，即使我们说我们的感知不重要，如果你运用常识并对自己诚实，你也可以从自己的游戏测试中获得反馈。但既然我们已经收集了反馈，我们可以用它做些什么呢？

  zh: 解释反馈
- en: You got what you wanted—lots of information about your game. What do you do
    now? Well, that depends on the feedback. You have different types and different
    ways to solve it. The easiest feedback to tackle is errors—for example, the door
    didn't open when I put in the key, the enemy won't die no matter how many bullets
    I shot at it, and so on. To solve these, you must carry out what the player did
    step by step so that you can reproduce the issue. Once you reproduce it, debug
    your game to see the error—maybe it's caused by a null check or a misconfiguration
    in the scene.
  id: totrans-24
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 你得到了你想要的——关于你的游戏的大量信息。现在你该怎么办？嗯，这取决于反馈。你有不同类型和不同的解决方法。最容易解决的反馈是错误，例如，当我放进钥匙时门没有打开，无论我射了多少子弹敌人都不会死，等等。要解决这些问题，你必须逐步进行玩家的操作，以便你能够重现问题。一旦你重现了它，调试你的游戏以查看错误——也许是由于空值检查或场景中的错误配置引起的。
- en: Try to gather as much detail about the situation as possible, such as when the
    issue occurred and at what level, which gear the player had, the number of lives
    the player had left, or if the player was in the air or crouched down—any data
    that allows you to get to the exact same situation. Some bugs can be tricky and
    can sometimes happen in the strangest situations. You might think that strange
    bugs that happen 1% of the time can be ignored, but remember that if your game
    is successful, it will be played by hundreds, maybe thousands, of players—that
    1% can really affect your player base.
  id: totrans-25
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 尽量收集关于情况的尽可能多的细节，比如问题发生的时间和级别，玩家拥有的装备，玩家剩下的生命次数，或者玩家是在空中还是蹲下——任何能让你达到完全相同情况的数据。有些错误可能很棘手，有时会在最奇怪的情况下发生。你可能会认为发生1%的奇怪错误可以忽略不计，但请记住，如果你的游戏成功，将会有数百，甚至数千名玩家玩——这1%可能会严重影响你的玩家群。
- en: Then, you have to balance the feedback. You could get feedback such as there
    weren't enough bullets, I had too many lives, the enemies are tough, the game
    is too easy, or the game is too hard. This must be considered alongside your objectives.
    Did you really want the player to be short on bullets or lives? Did you want the
    enemies to be hard to defeat? In this scenario, things that the player found difficult
    might be the exact experience you desired, and here is where you need to remember
    the target audience. Maybe the user that gave you that feedback is not who you
    expect to play the game (again, think of the example of *Dark Souls*, a game that
    is not for everyone). But if the player is the target audience, you might need
    to balance.
  id: totrans-26
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 然后，你需要平衡反馈。你可能会得到反馈，比如子弹不够，生命太多，敌人太难，游戏太容易，或者游戏太难。这必须与你的目标一起考虑。你真的希望玩家子弹或生命不够吗？你希望敌人难以击败吗？在这种情况下，玩家觉得困难的事情可能正是你想要的体验，这就是你需要记住目标受众的地方。也许给你反馈的用户不是你期望玩游戏的人（再次想想《黑暗之魂》的例子，这款游戏并不适合所有人）。但如果玩家是目标受众，你可能需要平衡。
- en: Balancing is when you need to tweak the game numbers, the amount of bullets,
    the amount of waves, the enemies, the enemies' lives, the enemies' bullets, and
    so on. That's why we exposed lots of properties of our scripts—so that they can
    be easily changed. This can be an extensive process. Getting all those numbers
    to work together is difficult. If you increase a property too much, another one
    might need to be reduced. Your game is basically a big spreadsheet of calculations.
    Actually, most game designers master the use of spreadsheets to do exactly this—balance
    the game, make calculations, and see how changing one cell changes the other—and
    before testing it the hard way, play the game.

  zh: 平衡是当你需要微调游戏数字，比如子弹数量、波数、敌人、敌人的生命、敌人的子弹等等。这就是为什么我们暴露了大量脚本属性——这样它们就可以很容易地改变。这可能是一个复杂的过程。让所有这些数字一起运作是困难的。如果你把一个属性增加得太多，可能需要减少另一个属性。你的游戏基本上就是一个大的计算表格。实际上，大多数游戏设计师都精通使用电子表格来做这件事——平衡游戏，进行计算，并看看改变一个单元格如何改变另一个单元格——在进行艰难的测试之前，先玩游戏。

- en: You can also get some feedback such as *"I don't understand why the player does
    what it does," "I don't understand the motives of the villains,"* and so on. This
    can be easy to underestimate, but remember that your game mechanics, aesthetics,
    and story (if any) must be in sync. If one of those elements fails, there is the
    risk of the rest of them also failing. If you have a futuristic history setting
    but your main weapon is a metal sword, you need to justify its existence somehow,
    perhaps with a story point. If your enemy wants to destroy the world but appears
    to be a kind person, you need to justify that somehow. These details are what
    make the game believable.
  id: totrans-32
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 你还可以得到一些反馈，比如“我不明白玩家为什么会这样做”，“我不明白反派的动机”，等等。这可能很容易被低估，但要记住，你的游戏机制、美学和故事（如果有的话）必须保持一致。如果其中一个元素失败了，其他元素也有失败的风险。如果你的游戏设定在未来，但你的主要武器是一把金属剑，你需要以某种方式证明它的存在，也许通过一个故事点。如果你的敌人想要摧毁世界，但看起来是一个善良的人，你需要以某种方式证明这一点。这些细节是使游戏可信的关键。
- en: Finally, you have perception feedback, such as *"the game didn't entertain me"*
    or *"I didn't enjoy the game."* That feedback can be converted into the other
    feedback if you ask the right questions, but sometimes, the tester doesn't know
    what the problem is; the game can just feel wrong in their eyes. This, of course,
    is not useful by itself, but don't underestimate it. It might be a hint that you
    need to do further testing.
  id: totrans-33
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 最后，你会得到感知反馈，比如“这个游戏没能让我娱乐”或“我不喜欢这个游戏”。如果你问对了问题，这些反馈可以转化为其他反馈，但有时测试人员不知道问题出在哪里；游戏可能在他们眼中感觉不对劲。当然，这本身并不有用，但不要低估它。这可能是你需要进行进一步测试的暗示。
- en: In game development, when you think you are finished with the game, you will
    discover that you have just started to develop it. Testing will make you realize
    that the game is not finished until the players are happy with the game, and that
    can take even more time than preparing the first version, so prepare for having
    to iterate the game a lot.

  zh: 在游戏开发中，当你认为游戏已经完成时，你会发现你刚刚开始开发它。测试会让你意识到游戏直到玩家对游戏满意才算完成，这可能需要比准备第一个版本更多的时间，所以要准备好不断迭代游戏。
- en: Big games, where the first prototype could take years, carry out testing in
    the early stages of their game, sometimes with fake assets to hide sensitive information
    that can spoil the game or make the competitors aware of their plans. Some developers
    even release a mini-game based on the main game, with a different story and aesthetics,
    just to test an idea. Also, there is the soft launch, where the game is released
    but to a restricted audience—maybe to a specific country that will not be your
    main audience and source of income—to test and iterate the game before releasing
    it to the rest of the world.

  zh: 大型游戏可能需要花费数年时间才能制作出第一个原型，在游戏的早期阶段进行测试，有时会使用虚假资产来隐藏可能泄露游戏信息或让竞争对手意识到他们的计划的敏感信息。一些开发者甚至会发布一个基于主游戏的迷你游戏，故事和美学不同，只是为了测试一个想法。此外，还有软发布，游戏会发布但只针对受限的受众——也许是特定国家，不是你的主要受众和收入来源——以在将游戏发布到全球之前测试和迭代游戏。

- en: One thing to do before pre-release, and ideally before you start developing
    your game, is to decide where you are going to sell your game. Nowadays, that
    means choosing a digital store—selling physical copies of games is not an option
    for newly starting independent developers. You have several options, but for PCs,
    the most common place for this is Steam, a well-known platform that allows you
    to upload your game to the platform for the price of 100 USD. After it is reviewed,
    it can then be published. On iOS, the only way is using the App Store, which charges
    100 USD per year for you to publish on it. Finally, on Android, you have the Play
    store, which allows you to publish on it for a one-off payment of 25 USD. Consoles
    have harder requisites, so we are not going to mention them.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在发布前和最好在开始开发游戏之前，要决定你将在哪里销售你的游戏。如今，这意味着选择一个数字商店——对于新兴独立开发者来说，销售实体游戏副本不是一个选择。你有几个选择，但对于PC来说，最常见的地方是Steam，这是一个知名平台，允许你以100美元的价格将游戏上传到平台上。经过审核后，就可以发布了。在iOS上，唯一的方式是使用App
    Store，它每年收取100美元的费用。最后，在Android上，你可以使用Play商店，它允许你以25美元的一次性付款发布游戏。游戏机有更严格的要求，所以我们不会提及它们。
- en: After picking a digital store, if you just release your game without any preparation,
    your game can be easily lost in the sea of releases that happen on the same day.
    Nowadays, the competition is strong, and dozens of games might be released on
    the same day as yours, so you must highlight your game somehow. There are lots
    of ways of doing this, but it requires experience in digital marketing, which
    can be difficult. It requires skills other than regular developer ones. If you
    insist on doing it by yourself without hiring someone, here are some things you
    can do.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在选择了一个数字商店之后，如果你没有做任何准备就发布你的游戏，你的游戏可能会在同一天发布的众多游戏中迅速被遗忘。如今，竞争是激烈的，可能会有数十款游戏在同一天发布，所以你必须以某种方式突出你的游戏。有很多方法可以做到这一点，但这需要数字营销方面的经验，这可能很困难。这需要除了常规开发者技能之外的技能。如果你坚持自己做而不雇人，这里有一些你可以做的事情。
- en: First, you can create a game community, such as a blog or group, where you can
    post information about your game regularly. This includes updates on its development,
    screenshots of new features, new concept art, and so on. Your job here is to capture
    the interest of players and keep them interested in your game even if it's not
    released yet, just to prepare them to buy your game as soon as it's released.
    Here, you need to be creative to keep their interest in the game—vary the content
    you post, maybe share some mini-games with your community with the opportunity
    to win prizes, or post questionnaires or giveaways; really, do anything that captures
    the attention of your audience.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 首先，你可以创建一个游戏社区，比如一个博客或者群组，在这里你可以定期发布关于你的游戏的信息。这包括开发进展的更新、新功能的截图、新概念艺术等等。你的工作是吸引玩家的兴趣，即使游戏还没有发布，也要让他们对你的游戏保持兴趣，为了让他们在游戏发布时立刻购买。在这里，你需要有创意来保持他们对游戏的兴趣——变化发布的内容，也许与社区分享一些迷你游戏，让他们有机会赢得奖品，或者发布问卷调查或赠品；真的，做任何能吸引你观众注意的事情。
- en: Also, try to develop a community when you are not too near but not too far from
    the release date. That way, you won't lose the attention of the players due to
    long wait times and you can be honest with the expectations of your game. They
    will change a lot during the development and the scope is likely to be reduced
    from its initial design. You will need to deal with the hype, which can be dangerous.
  id: totrans-48
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 另外，尽量在离发布日期不是太近也不是太远的时候发展社区。这样，你就不会因为长时间等待而失去玩家的注意力，也可以对游戏的期望值诚实。游戏在开发过程中会发生很多变化，范围可能会从最初的设计中减少。你需要处理炒作，这可能是危险的。
- en: Of course, we need people to join the community, so you must publish it somewhere.
    You can pay for ads, but aside from the cost and difficulty to make them relevant,
    there are other free ways of doing this. You might send a free copy of your game
    to an influencer, such as a YouTuber or an Instagrammer, so that they can play
    your game and give a review to their audience. This can be difficult if the influencer
    doesn't like the game as they will be honest, and that can be bad for you. So,
    you really need to be sure to give them a polished version, but not necessarily

  zh: 当然，我们需要人们加入社区，所以你必须在某个地方发布它。你可以付费广告，但除了成本和难以使它们相关之外，还有其他免费的方法。你可以把你的游戏免费送给一位影响者，比如一个YouTuber或Instagrammer，让他们玩你的游戏并向他们的观众发表评论。如果影响者不喜欢游戏，这可能会很困难，因为他们会诚实，这对你来说可能是不利的。所以，你真的需要确保给他们一个精心制作的版本，但不一定是最终版本。你也可以接触一些付费的影响者，但同样，这需要花钱。
- en: You have other free options, such as going onto forums or groups and posting
    information about your game, but be sensible here. Don't make your post feel like
    cheap advertising—know where you are publishing. Some groups don't like those
    kinds of posts and will reject them. Try to look for places that allow that kind
    of self-advertising. There are groups intended just for that, so just avoid being
    invasive in certain communities.

  zh: 你还有其他免费的选择，比如进入论坛或群组，发布关于你的游戏的信息，但要明智。不要让你的帖子感觉像廉价的广告——知道你在哪里发布。有些群体不喜欢这类帖子，会拒绝它们。试着寻找允许这种自我宣传的地方。有些群体就是为此而设立的，所以在某些社区中避免侵入性。
- en: 'Finally, another option you have is to contact a publisher, a company that
    specializes in doing this kind of marketing. They will allocate money for publishing
    and will have people that work to manage your communities, which can be a big
    relief. You have more time to create your game, but it also has some drawbacks.
    First, of course, they will get a cut of your game revenue, and depending on the
    publisher, this can be really high. However, you need to contrast that with the
    revenue you will get by doing your own marketing. Also, publishers will ask you
    to change your game to meet their criteria. Some ask for your game to be localized
    (supporting several languages) or ask for your game to support certain controllers,
    to have a certain way to do tutorials, and so on. Finally, consider that certain
    publishers are associated with certain types of games, so if you are creating
    an intense action game, you wouldn''t publish it with a casual-games publisher.
    Find the right publisher for you:'

  zh: 最后，你还有另一个选择，就是联系出版商，一家专门从事这种营销的公司。他们会拨款用于出版，并有专人负责管理你的社区，这可能会给你带来很大的帮助。你会有更多时间来创建你的游戏，但也会有一些缺点。首先，当然，他们会从你的游戏收入中抽成，而且根据出版商的不同，这个比例可能会很高。然而，你需要权衡一下，通过自己的营销能获得的收入。此外，出版商会要求你改变你的游戏以满足他们的标准。有些要求你的游戏本地化（支持多种语言），或者要求你的游戏支持某些控制器，有一定的教程方式等等。最后，要考虑到某些出版商与某些类型的游戏有关联，所以如果你正在创建一个激烈的动作游戏，你不会选择与休闲游戏出版商合作。找到适合你的出版商：

  zh: 除了你的游戏可能需要在所选的数字商店平台上进行的所有设置和集成（这取决于你的受众），在发布时还有一些需要考虑的事情。
- en: Some stores might have a review process, which consists of playing your game
    and seeing whether it meets the criteria of the store. As an example, at the time
    of writing this book, the Apple App Store requires every game they publish to
    have some kind of social sign-in option (such as Facebook, Google, and so on)
    and to also support Apple sign-in. They will simply not admit your game if you
    do not comply. Another example is PS Vita, which asks your game to support some
    kind of interaction with its front or rear touchpads. So, be aware early on about
    these requirements. They can affect the release of your game a lot if you don't
    take care of it.

  zh: 一些商店可能会有一个审查过程，包括玩你的游戏，看看它是否符合商店的标准。举个例子，在写这本书的时候，苹果应用商店要求他们发布的每款游戏都必须有某种社交登录选项（比如Facebook、Google等），并且还要支持苹果登录。如果你不遵守这些规定，他们就不会接受你的游戏。另一个例子是PS
    Vita，它要求你的游戏支持与前后触摸板的某种交互。所以，要早早了解这些要求。如果你不注意，它们会对你的游戏发布产生很大影响。
- en: Aside from these requirements, of course, there are other criteria to be met,
    such as whether there is adult or violent content. Consider a platform that supports
    the kind of game you have created. Some can even ask you to get ratings from the
    **Entertainment Software Rating Board** (**ESRB**) or similar rating boards. Another
    common requirement that you need to be aware of is that the game should not crash,
    at least not in the usual workflow of the game. Also, the game must perform well,
    can't have intense performance issues, and sometimes, your initial game download
    size can't exceed a specified maximum limit, which you can usually solve by downloading
    the content in the game itself (look for the **Addressables** Unity package for
    this). Again, all of these requirements vary depending on the store.
  id: totrans-60

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 除了这些要求，当然还有其他需要满足的标准，比如是否有成人或暴力内容。考虑一个支持你所创建游戏类型的平台。有些甚至可能要求你从**娱乐软件评级委员会**（**ESRB**）或类似的评级机构获得评级。你需要注意的另一个常见要求是游戏不应该崩溃，至少不应该在游戏的常规工作流程中崩溃。此外，游戏必须表现良好，不能有严重的性能问题，有时，你的初始游戏下载大小不能超过指定的最大限制，你通常可以通过在游戏本身中下载内容来解决这个问题（查找**Addressables**
    Unity包）。再次强调，所有这些要求都取决于商店。
- en: Now, even if these requirements are met, the process to check them can take
    time—days, weeks, or sometimes even months. So, keep this in mind when defining
    a release date. In big consoles where this process can take months, sometimes
    the developers use that time to create the famous day-1 patch, a patch that fixes
    bugs that won't stop the game from being released but help with the overall game
    experience. It's a questionable but understandable practice.

  zh: 即使满足了这些要求，检查它们的过程可能需要时间 - 几天、几周，甚至有时几个月。所以，在确定发布日期时要记住这一点。在大型游戏机上，这个过程可能需要几个月，有时开发者会利用这段时间创建著名的第一天补丁，这是一个修复bug的补丁，虽然不会阻止游戏发布，但有助于整体游戏体验。这是一个值得商榷但可以理解的做法。
- en: Finally, remember that the first day of the release is critical. You will be
    in the **New Releases** section of the store, and here is where you will have
    the most exposure. After that, all exposure will mostly rely on your marketing
    and sales. Some stores allow you to be featured. You can talk directly with representatives
    of the store and see how you can do this. If the store is interested in your game,
    they might feature you (or you might have to pay for that). The first day is important,
    so be prepared for that.

  zh: 最后，记住发布的第一天至关重要。你将出现在商店的**新发布**部分，这是你获得最多曝光的地方。之后，所有的曝光主要都依赖于你的营销和销售。一些商店允许你被推荐。你可以直接与商店的代表交谈，看看你能否做到这一点。如果商店对你的游戏感兴趣，他们可能会推荐你（或者你可能需要为此付费）。第一天很重要，所以要做好准备。

- en: Even if the game is released, this is not an excuse to stop testing it. You
    can actually get even more feedback if your game is played by thousands of people.
    Sadly, you can't be there to observe them, but you can automate the information-gathering
    process. You can do this by making your code report analytics to a server, as
    the Unity Analytics package does. Even if this information is not as direct as
    in-person testing, a massive amount of data and statistics can be gathered this
    way, and you can improve the game on the fly thanks to updates, something that
    old games couldn't do as easily as they can today. No game is released perfect,
    and sometimes, due to time pressures, you might need to roll out an early release,
    so prepare your game to be updated regularly after release. There are some cases
    of games that had a bad launch but were resurrected from the grave. Don't underestimate
    that last course of action. You have already spent too much to give up on your
    badly released game.

  zh: 即使游戏已经发布，这并不是停止测试的借口。如果你的游戏被成千上万的人玩，你实际上可以获得更多的反馈。遗憾的是，你不能在那里观察他们，但你可以自动化信息收集过程。你可以通过让你的代码向服务器报告分析数据来做到这一点，就像Unity
    Analytics包所做的那样。即使这些信息不像面对面测试那样直接，但通过这种方式可以收集大量的数据和统计信息，你可以通过更新实时改进游戏，这是老游戏无法像今天这样轻松做到的。没有游戏是完美的，有时由于时间压力，你可能需要提前发布游戏，所以准备好在发布后定期更新游戏。有一些游戏在发布时表现不佳，但后来得以重生。不要低估最后的行动。你已经花了太多时间来放弃你发布不佳的游戏。
- en: Also, if your monetization model relies on in-app purchases, which means people
    spend money on loot boxes or cosmetic items, you will need to have constant content
    updates. This will keep the players playing your game. The more they play the
    game, the more money will be spent on it. You might take advantage of the information
    you gather through analytics not only to fix your game but also to decide which
    content is being consumed most by your players and focus on that. You can also
    carry out A/B testing, which consists of releasing two versions of the update
    to different users and seeing which one is the most successful. This allows you
    to test ideas on a live game. As you can see, there is still plenty of work to
    do. Also, use metrics to track whether players are losing interest in your game,
    and if so, why—is there a difficult level? Is the game too easy? Pay attention
    to your player base. Ask them questions in the communities you created, or just
    look at the reviews—users are usually willing to tell you how they would like
    their favorite game to be improved.

  zh: 此外，如果你的货币化模式依赖于应用内购买，这意味着人们会在战利品箱或装饰物上花钱，你将需要不断更新内容。这将使玩家继续玩你的游戏。他们玩得越多，就会在游戏上花费更多的钱。你可以利用通过分析收集的信息，不仅修复你的游戏，还可以决定哪些内容被玩家消费最多，并专注于那些内容。你还可以进行A/B测试，即向不同用户发布两个版本的更新，看哪个版本最成功。这使你可以在实时游戏中测试想法。正如你所看到的，还有很多工作要做。此外，使用指标来跟踪玩家是否对你的游戏失去兴趣，如果是，为什么——是有难度的关卡吗？游戏太容易了吗？关注你的玩家群体。在你创建的社区中向他们提问，或者只是看评论——用户通常愿意告诉你他们希望如何改进他们最喜欢的游戏。

- en: Developing the game is just one part of the work; releasing it to be successful
    can be a huge task. Sometimes, it can cost more than the game itself. So, unless
    you are making a game for fun, if you want to make your game for a living, you
    will need to learn how to manage releases or hire people that are capable of helping
    with the pre-release, release, and post-release phases of your game, which can
    be a smart move.
