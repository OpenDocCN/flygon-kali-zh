- en: The Raspberry Pi Zero is a powerful, low-cost, credit-card sized computer, which
    lends itself perfectly to begin the controller of sophisticated home automation
    devices. Using the available on-board interfaces, the Raspberry Pi Zero can be
    expanded to allow the connection of a virtually infinite number of security sensors
    and devices.

  zh: 树莓派Zero是一款功能强大、价格低廉、信用卡大小的计算机，非常适合开始控制复杂的家庭自动化设备。使用可用的板载接口，树莓派Zero可以扩展，允许连接几乎无限数量的安全传感器和设备。
- en: 'Since the Arduino platform is more versatile and useful for making projects,
    including the networking applications of the Internet of Things, this is what
    we will see in this book: the integration of devices connected to the nodes using
    the amazing and important Arduino board, and how to integrate the Raspberry Pi
    Zero to control and monitor the devices from a central interface working as a
    hub. With software programming you will create an Internet of Things system based
    in developing technologies such as JavaScript, HTML5, and Node.js.'
