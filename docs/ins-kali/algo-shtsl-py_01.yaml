    things melting faster than the polar ice caps are assets under active management.
    Evolution does not take prisoners. If active managers do not want to go join the
    bluefin tuna on the list of endangered species, then maybe learning to sell short
    would be an invaluable skill to add to their arsenal. As the global financial
    crisis of 2007-2008 showed us, it's crucial for market participants to be capable
    of generating profits not only in bull but also in bear markets. To that end,
    this book will cover the ins and outs of short selling, and develop algorithmic
    strategies to maximize its effectiveness, with the end goal of creating a robust
    investment product that will set you apart from your market competitors.

- en: In real life, you deal with this seemingly random response by aborting the mission.
    You don't wait until you are married with a couple of kids in tow, a dead goldfish
    in a bowl, and a mountain of green vegetables rotting in the fridge to break up.
    It's the same with the markets. A stock might tick all the boxes, but something
    unforeseen or overlooked pops up and you bail. When we focus all our energy on
    stock picking, we try to solve randomness with certainty. Trying harder next time
    to pick the right stock does not solve randomness. Perfectionism is a form of
    procrastination. The only way to deal with randomness is to accept our fallibility.
    The faster we fail, the faster we move on.

  zh: 在现实生活中，你会因为这种看似随机的反应而放弃任务。你不会等到结婚了，带着一对孩子，碗里的金鱼死了，冰箱里的一堆绿色蔬菜都腐烂了才分手。市场也是一样的。一支股票可能符合所有条件，但突然出现了一些意外或被忽视的情况，你就会选择退出。当我们把所有精力都放在选股上时，我们试图用确定性来解决随机性。下次更努力地挑选正确的股票并不能解决随机性。完美主义是一种拖延症。处理随机性的唯一方法是接受我们的不完美。我们失败得越快，就能越快地继续前进。
- en: Let's illustrate this concept with a practical example. We can all agree that
    stocks underperforming their benchmark have peaked out relative to the index.
    Within the population that has hit a ceiling, there are 100% of the future underperformers
    (which would be our key target for short selling) plus some stocks that will meander
    sideways and go nowhere until they trend again. There is simply no easy way to
    discriminate the former from the latter *a priori*. There are, however, simple
    techniques to deal with freeloaders *a posteriori*. The way to beat randomness
    is not to try and be a better stock picker. The way to beat randomness is to accept
    that at one point or another, you will pick losers and learn how to deal with
    them. People see all those great market wizards for the few picks that worked
    well. They do not look at all the ones that were discarded along the way. We have
    it backward. We want the medal before the race. Great stock pickers should be
    judged on what they choose to keep, rather than the less profitable picks they
    discard along the way.

  zh: 让我们用一个实际的例子来说明这个概念。我们都可以同意，相对于指数，表现不佳的股票已经达到了峰值。在达到顶峰的股票中，有100%是未来的表现不佳者（这将是我们卖空的主要目标），还有一些股票将会横盘并且不会走向任何方向，直到再次趋势。没有简单的方法来区分前者和后者。然而，有简单的技术来处理后者。战胜随机性的方法不是试图成为更好的股票选择者。战胜随机性的方法是接受在某个时候你会选择失败者，并学会如何处理他们。人们看到所有那些伟大的市场巫师因为几次成功的选择而伟大。他们没有看到一路上被丢弃的那些不太赚钱的选择。我们把事情搞反了。我们想要在比赛之前得到奖牌。伟大的股票选择者应该根据他们选择保留的东西来评判，而不是根据他们在一路上丢弃的不太赚钱的选择来评判。

- en: The mechanics of short selling are deceptively simple. For example, you sell
    a stock at 100, buy it back at 90, and pocket the 10\. It works in **absolute**
    or **relative** to a benchmark. There is only one additional step that needs to
    take place before the short sale. Short sellers deliver shares they do not own.
    So, they borrow those shares from a stock lending desk with their brokerage house
    first. Once they buy the shares back and close the trade, they return those shares.

  zh: 卖空的机制是欺骗性的简单。例如，你以100的价格卖出一只股票，以90的价格买回来，然后赚取10。这适用于**绝对**或**相对**于基准。在卖空之前只需要进行一个额外的步骤。卖空者卖出他们没有拥有的股票。因此，他们首先从他们的经纪公司的股票借贷台借这些股票。一旦他们买回股票并平仓，他们就会归还这些股票。
- en: Do not let that simplicity fool you. Due to the infinite, complex, random nature
    of the game that we have considered in this chapter, 90% of market participants
    fail. Of the remaining 10%, fewer than half will ever engage in short selling.
    That is the unapologetic reality of the markets.

- en: If virtually everyone fails on the forgiving abundance of the long side, then
    for you to survive on the merciless aridity of the short side, this book must
    be intentionally different. This book will take you on a road far less traveled.
    You might disagree with parts of it, but you will come out transformed. For example,
    like 100% of the people before you, you will conclude that stock picking is bankrupt.
    You will also get to see for yourself exactly where the money is generated within
    the investment process.

  zh: 总结
- en: In this chapter, we set the context for the rest of the book. The stock market
    is neither an art form nor a science. Market wizards are not born, nor do they
    need to be supremely intelligent. They are forged in the crucible of adversity.
    The stock market is an infinite, complex, random game. The only way to win this
    game is to stay in it, by adapting your strategy to the market's infinite, complex,
    random nature, and to pick stocks and cut losses accordingly. In the coming chapters,
    we will consider how to incorporate short selling into your trading strategy,
    and implement techniques to improve your success rate and gain expectancy.

  zh: 在本章中，我们为本书的其余部分设定了背景。股市既不是艺术形式，也不是科学。市场巫师不是天生的，也不需要非常聪明。他们是在逆境的熔炉中锻造出来的。股市是一个无限、复杂、随机的游戏。赢得这场游戏的唯一方法是留在其中，通过调整你的策略来适应市场的无限、复杂、随机的特性，并相应地选择股票和削减损失。在接下来的章节中，我们将考虑如何将卖空纳入你的交易策略，并实施技术来提高你的成功率和获利预期。
- en: Market participants are generally less comfortable selling short than buying
    long. This is down to a number of technical factors, but also because of a general
    fear of the practice, propagated by the number of myths related to short selling.
    We will discuss and disprove these in the next chapter.
