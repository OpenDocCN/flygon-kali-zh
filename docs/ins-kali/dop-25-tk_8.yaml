  zh: 我们做了什么？
- en: We explored quite a few topics that are beyond "normal" Kubernetes usage. We
    learned how to scale Pods using HorizontalPodAutoscaler. We saw that scaling Pods
    does not provide enough benefits if we cannot scale cluster nodes as well. We
    explored how to do just that using Cluster Autoscaler. Unfortunately, it is currently
    available only for AWS, GKE, and AKS.

  zh: 我们探讨了一些超出“正常”Kubernetes使用范围的主题。我们学会了如何使用HorizontalPodAutoscaler来扩展Pods。我们发现，如果不能扩展集群节点，扩展Pods并不能提供足够的好处。我们探讨了如何使用Cluster
    Autoscaler来做到这一点。不幸的是，目前它只适用于AWS、GKE和AKS。
- en: While scaling Pods and nodes is essential, we had to gather metrics as well.
    They give us insights into the behavior of our clusters and applications running
    inside it. For that, we adopted Prometheus. More importantly, we saw how we can
    leverage Alertmanager to create notifications that will alert us when there is
    an issue, instead of staring at a screen waiting for a graph to reach a "red line".

  zh: 虽然扩展Pods和节点是必不可少的，但我们也需要收集指标。它们让我们了解集群和其中运行的应用程序的行为。为此，我们采用了Prometheus。更重要的是，我们看到了如何利用Alertmanager创建通知，当出现问题时会提醒我们，而不是盯着屏幕等待图表达到“红线”。
- en: We learned that gathering metrics from exporters might not be enough, so we
    instrumented our applications as a way of providing lower level metrics that give
    us deep insights into the state of our applications.

  zh: 我们了解到，仅从出口商那里收集指标可能不够，因此我们将我们的应用程序作为提供更低级别指标的一种方式，让我们深入了解我们应用程序的状态。
- en: We also explored HorizontalPodAutoscaler's ability to use custom metrics. We
    hooked it into Prometheus thus extending scaling thresholds to almost any formula
    we could imagine.

  zh: 我们还探讨了HorizontalPodAutoscaler使用自定义指标的能力。我们将其连接到了Prometheus，从而将扩展阈值扩展到几乎我们能想象的任何公式。
- en: Given that we collect metrics in Prometheus and that it doesn't provide dashboarding
    functionality, we connected it to Grafana. During the process, we explored ways
    that dashboards can be made more useful than traditional "pretty colors" many
    are instinctively drawn to.

  zh: 鉴于我们在Prometheus中收集指标，并且它不提供仪表板功能，我们将其连接到了Grafana。在这个过程中，我们探讨了如何使仪表板比许多人本能地被吸引的传统“漂亮颜色”更有用。
- en: Finally, we discussed the need for centralized logging as well as a few tools
    that might help us debug issues discovered through alerts. For that, we evaluated
    Papertrail, AWS CloudWatch, GCP Stackdriver, Azure Log Analytics, and the Elasticsearch-Fluentd-Kibana
    (EFK) stack.

  zh: 最后，我们讨论了集中式日志记录的需求，以及一些可能帮助我们通过警报发现问题的工具。为此，我们评估了Papertrail、AWS CloudWatch、GCP
    Stackdriver、Azure Log Analytics和Elasticsearch-Fluentd-Kibana（EFK）堆栈。
- en: We went beyond common Kubernetes operations and managed to make our clusters
    more robust and more reliable. We made a step forward towards mostly autonomous
    self-adaptive systems that require human intervention only in exceptional cases
    that cannot be resolved automatically. When we do need to intervene, we'll do
    that equipped with all the necessary information required to quickly deduce the
    cause of the issue and perform corrective actions that will restore our cluster
    to the desired state.

  zh: 我们超越了常规的Kubernetes操作，成功使我们的集群更加健壮和可靠。我们迈出了一步，朝着大部分自适应系统迈进，这些系统只在无法自动解决的特殊情况下需要人工干预。当我们需要干预时，我们将装备所有必要的信息，以快速推断问题的原因并执行纠正措施，将我们的集群恢复到期望的状态。

- en: Like the previous books, this one was also a collaboration effort. Many helped
    shape this book through discussions, notes, and bug reports. I was swarmed with
    comments through *DevOps20* ([http://slack.devops20toolkit.com/](http://slack.devops20toolkit.com/)) Slack
    (often private) messages and emails. The conversations I had with the readers
    of the early editions of the book influenced the end result significantly. I'm
    grateful to have such a great community behind me. **Thank you for helping me
    make this book great.**
