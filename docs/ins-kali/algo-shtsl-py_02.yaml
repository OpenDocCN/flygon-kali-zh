- en: Since the 1975 movie *Jaws*, whenever we get in the water, we all have this
    instinctive apprehension about what swims beneath. Sharks are unparalleled killing
    machines. They have a better detection system than the most technologically advanced
    sonar. They swim faster than speed boats. They have three rows of razor-sharp
    teeth that continuously regrow. Yet, did you know that deep in the comfort of
    your home, somewhere in the dark, there is something a thousand times deadlier
    than any great white? There are, on average, 80 shark attacks every year, mostly
    exploratory bites and mistaken identity. Meanwhile, falling out of bed carries
    a far greater probability. Sharks are majestic creatures. If they wanted us dead,
    we would be. Apparently, they don't like junk food.

    versus passive investing debate. Active management refers to fund managers taking
    bets away from the benchmark, a practice referred to as active money. Passive
    investing refers to minimizing the tracking error by mimicking the index. Active
    managers claim their stock-picking ability and portfolio management skills deliver
    superior returns. However, the numbers tell a different story. According to S&P's
    *Index versus Active* reports, the vast majority of active managers underperform
    the S&P 500 benchmark on 1, 3, and 5 year-horizons. This means that their cumulative
    compounded returns are lower than the benchmark. **Exchange-Traded Funds**, or
    **ETFs**, fared better than active managers every year on record, even during
    the most severe market downturns.

  zh: 没有什么比主动与被动投资辩论更能说明“故事与数字”二分法更好了。主动管理指的是基金经理从基准中押注，这种做法被称为主动资金。被动投资指的是通过模仿指数来最小化跟踪误差。主动管理者声称他们的选股能力和投资组合管理技能能够提供优越的回报。然而，数字讲述了一个不同的故事。根据标普的“指数与主动”报告，绝大多数主动管理者在1、3和5年的时间跨度内都表现不如标普500指数。这意味着他们的累积复利回报低于基准。交易所交易基金（ETF）在记录的每一年都比主动管理者表现更好，甚至在最严重的市场衰退期间也是如此。
- en: 'A more detailed report regarding active manager performance compared to the

- en: The proof is in the pudding. The burden of proof is no longer on ETFs but on
    active managers to prove that they can deliver more than the index. The debate
    has gradually shifted from "which manager should we allocate to?" to "remind me
    again why we should be going with an expensive underperforming benchmark hugger
    when there is a liquid, better, cheaper alternative?"
  id: totrans-28

  zh: 事实就在眼前。证明的责任不再在ETF上，而在主动管理者身上，证明他们能够提供比指数更多的回报。辩论已经逐渐从“我们应该分配给哪个经理？”转变为“再次提醒我，为什么我们应该选择一个昂贵的表现不佳的基准追踪者，而不是选择一个流动性更好、更便宜的替代品？”
- en: 'Unfortunately, there is more. The penalty for deviating from the benchmark
    is severe. If managers deviate and outperform, they are knighted as "stock pickers."
    Yet, when they stray and underperform, they are dubbed as having "high tracking
    errors." This often leads to redemptions, the kiss of death for fund managers.
    When the choice is between becoming a hero or keeping your job, self-preservation
    compels active managers to mirror the benchmark, a practice referred to as **closet
    indexing**. This is the famous "*no-one ever got fired for holding [insert big
    safe blue-chip stock here…]*" line. If active managers end up mirroring their
    benchmark, then the "active versus passive" debate is a misnomer. It really comes
    down to a choice between low-cost indexing via an index fund versus expensive
    closet indexing via a self-preserving active manager. Either way, you get the
    same index, but with the latter, you also have to pay a middle-man, called an
    active manager. As John Boggle, founder of Vanguard, used to say: "*in investing,
    you get what you don''t pay for*."'

  zh: 不幸的是，情况更糟。偏离基准的惩罚是严重的。如果经理们偏离并取得超额收益，他们被封为“选股专家”。然而，当他们偏离并表现不佳时，他们被称为“高跟踪误差”。这经常导致赎回，对基金经理来说是致命的一击。当选择是成为英雄还是保住工作时，自我保护促使主动管理者模仿基准，这种做法被称为“衣柜指数化”。这就是著名的“*没有人因持有[在这里插入大型安全蓝筹股票的名字]而被解雇*”的说法。如果主动管理者最终模仿他们的基准，那么“主动与被动”的辩论就是一个误称。这实际上是在低成本指数化和高成本衣柜指数化之间做出选择，前者通过指数基金实现，后者则通过自我保护的主动管理者实现。无论哪种方式，你都得到了相同的指数，但是后者还必须支付一个中间人，称为主动管理者。正如万得宝创始人约翰·博格尔曾经说过的：“*在投资中，你得到了你没有付出的东西*。”
- en: That does not mean active management should die an unceremonious death. There
    are exceptional active managers worth every penny of their management fees. It
    simply means that the average active mutual fund manager gives active management
    a bad name. Investors who go down the active management route not only take an
    equity risk premium. They also take an active management risk premium. The current
    crisis of active management is nothing but the time-honored routine of the middle
    man in every industry who realizes that they can no longer delay efficiency.

  zh: 这并不意味着主动管理应该死得不名不正。有些杰出的主动管理者物有所值，他们的管理费是值得的。这只是意味着普通的主动共同基金经理给主动管理抹了黑。选择主动管理路线的投资者不仅承担股权风险溢价，还承担主动管理风险溢价。主动管理目前的危机只不过是每个行业中中间人的老生常谈，他们意识到自己再也无法拖延效率了。

    bad breath, colorful language, and small positions relative to the overall float,
    then faith in capitalism should join the great white shark and polar bear in the
    list of endangered species. The national sport of short sellers is to unveil paradoxes
    in the fabric of the corporate space-time continuum. Ignorance and competence
    cannot exist in the same place at the same time. Basically, you cannot pretend
    to know what you are doing if you don't know what is going on. Strangely enough,
    this is a lie embattled CEOs would like us to believe. Whenever they are questioned
    about the illicit activities of their subordinates, their first line of defense
    is to feign indignation and throw them under the Bentley, pretending that they
    were unaware of the illicit actions perpetrated by a few isolated rogue individuals.

    cover-up, or they really do not know what is going on and therefore incompetent.
    Either way, they are unfit for duty and undeserving of their compensation packages.

- en: In 2008, banking top executives were contemplating the abyss from the parapet
    of their corner offices. The banking lobby promptly marched up to Washington to
    demand a moratorium on short selling. In response, the U.S. **Securities and Exchange
    Commission** (**SEC**) put a temporary ban on short selling in the country in
    an effort to "restore equilibrium to the markets." This was lifted a short time
    later. Once the dust had settled, some analysis was done on the effect of the
    short selling ban, and the Federal Reserve published a report in which they concluded
    that short selling actually reduces volatility.

    of 2008, regulators in a number of countries banned short selling of particular
    stocks and industries. Evidence suggests that these bans did little to stop the
    slide in stock prices, but significantly increased costs of liquidity. In August
    2011, the U.S. market experienced a large decline when Standard and Poor''s announced
    a downgrade of U.S. debt. Our cross-sectional tests suggest that the decline in
    stock prices was not significantly driven or amplified by short selling. Short
    selling does not appear to be the root cause of recent stock market declines.
    Furthermore, banning short selling does not appear to prevent stock prices from
    falling when firm-specific or economy-wide economic fundamentals are weak, and
    may impose high costs on market participants."'

- en: Short sellers simply do not have the firepower to torpedo share prices. Short
    sellers need to borrow shares in order to sell short. This comes from shareholders
    who lend a fraction of their holdings to stock loan desks. Borrow availability
    usually averages less than 10% of the free float, in other words, the portion
    of shares available to public investors. This means that short sellers represent
    a fraction of the overall sell volume.
